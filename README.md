# my_containers

- In this project, I implemented a few container types of the C++ standard template library:
- 1) vector
- 2) stack (vector class as default underlying container)
- 3) map
- 4) set
(red-black tree was implemented for map and set)

- also was implemented:
- iterators_traits
- reverse_iterator
- enable_if
- is_integral
- equal and lexicographical_compare
- std::pair
- std::make_pair

- it was used std::allocator

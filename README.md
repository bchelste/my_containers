# my_containers
____
In this project, I implemented a few container types of the C++ standard template library:

:white_check_mark: vector

:white_check_mark: stack (vector class as default underlying container)

:white_check_mark: map

:white_check_mark: set

:red_circle: 	:black_circle: (red-black tree was implemented for map and set)
____

also was implemented:
- iterators_traits
- reverse_iterator
- enable_if
- is_integral
- equal and lexicographical_compare
- std::pair
- std::make_pair

it was used std::allocator
